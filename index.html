        <p>Welcome to "Guess My Number"! This exciting game challenges you to guess a hidden number chosen by the
            computer. Follow this manual to learn how to play and enjoy the game.</p>

        <h2>Game Objective</h2>
        <p>The objective of "Guess My Number" is to guess the hidden number selected by the computer. The number will be
            between 1 and 20 inclusive.</p>

        <h2>How to Play</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Start the Game</strong>: When you start the game, the computer will randomly select a number
                between 1 and 20.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Make a Guess</strong>: Enter your guess in the input field. Your guess must be a whole number
                between 1 and 20.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Feedback</strong>: After you enter your guess, the computer will provide feedback:
                <ul>
                    <li>If your guess is correct, the computer will congratulate you and the game will end.</li>
                    <li>If your guess is too high, the computer will inform you that the guess is too high.</li>
                    <li>If your guess is too low, the computer will inform you that the guess is too low.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Continue Guessing</strong>: Use the feedback to adjust your next guess and continue until you
                guess the correct number.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Winning the Game</strong>: When you guess the correct number, the computer will display a
                congratulatory message. You can then choose to start a new game or exit.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Rules</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Guess Range</strong>: You must guess a number between 1 and 20. Guesses outside this range are
                invalid.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Single Input</strong>: Enter only one number at a time in the input field.</li>
            <li><strong>Continuous Play</strong>: The game continues until you guess the correct number. There is no
                limit to the number of guesses you can make.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Tips for Success</h2>
        <p class="tip"><strong>Start in the Middle</strong>: A good initial guess is 10, which is in the middle of the
            range. This can help you quickly determine whether the hidden number is higher or lower.</p>
        <p class="tip"><strong>Use Feedback Wisely</strong>: Adjust your guesses based on whether the feedback indicates
            your guess was too high or too low.</p>
        <p class="tip"><strong>Narrow Down</strong>: Each time you receive feedback, you can halve the range of possible
            numbers, making it easier to zero in on the correct guess.</p>

        <h2>Example Game</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>The computer selects a hidden number (e.g., 14).</li>
            <li>You guess 10.
                <ul>
                    <li>The computer responds, "Too low!"</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>You guess 15.
                <ul>
                    <li>The computer responds, "Too high!"</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>You guess 13.
                <ul>
                    <li>The computer responds, "Too low!"</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>You guess 14.
                <ul>
                    <li>The computer responds, "Congratulations! You guessed the correct number!"</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Invalid Input</strong>: If you enter a number outside the range of 1 to 20, the computer will
                prompt you to enter a valid number within the range.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Non-Numeric Input</strong>: If you enter non-numeric characters, the computer will prompt you to
                enter a valid number.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>"Guess My Number" is a simple yet engaging game that sharpens your number-guessing skills. Enjoy the
            challenge, use logical reasoning, and have fun guessing!</p>
